S'"""perception\n\nPotentially perceptable people perceive partial properties.\n\nA lot of computation chemistry involves the perception of various\nchemical properties.  The term perception is used because some\nchemists have different beliefs about what defines chemical\nproperties.\n\nThe list of properties that frowns perceives is the following:\n\nSmallest Set of Smallest Rings\nAromaticity (which depends on the smallest set of smallest rings)\n\nThese routines are designed to be flexible, that is they can be\nrelaplaced by other routines easily.\n\nEach of the derived perception routines has the following\nsignature:\n\nmolecule = perception(molecule)\n\nThis format is retained because in the future a copy of the molecule\nwith the appropriate annotations might be returned.\n\nCurrently for the sake of speed the molecule is modified (not\na copy of the molecule)  This may change in the future.\n"""'
