PySomorph - Subgraph isomorphism python extension.

INSTALLATION:

You must have swig 1.3+ installed.  If you do not you
can go to http://www.swig.org/ and download the correct
version.  This package has been tested on 

1) OSX 10.2 (darwin + jaguar)
2) Linux (Redhat 7)
3) Microsoft Windows

To see examples of usage see 
 test_vf.py 
 test_vflib.py
 test_matches.py

A simple graph implementation that coexists with PySomorph is included
in the NetworkGraph package.  I suggest reading the enclosed Readme
file and examining the supplied source code.

For the hard-core a graph based regular expression scheme for 
chemistry that uses vflib can be found at 
http://frowns.sourceforge.net/
