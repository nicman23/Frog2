# Report from Jean Pierre Ebejer

Cause: Failure in isRingChiralClass for neighboursPlaced == 1 (ring not there yet)

BugFix:
# In tools.py setCoord():

    if ori.chiral_class:
	    if ori.rings:
	    # Bug fix: ADDED (len(neighboursPlaced) > 1) and 
	    # To prevent isRingChiralSens call
		    if (len(neighboursPlaced) > 1) and (not isRingChiralSens(ori, neighboursPlaced, neighboursToPlace, saveindex, verbose = verbose)):
			    sens *= -1
	    else:
		    smilesorder, currentorder = getChiralNeighbours(ori, neighboursPlaced, neighboursToPlace, saveindex, verbose = verbose)
		    if not issamesens(smilesorder, currentorder):
			    sens *= -1
