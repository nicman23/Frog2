=========================================================================

- **Missing features**: 

  Full documentation about various options (contributions welcome).

=========================================================================

- **Future directions** (Improvements under consideration):

  - include ring flexibility in conformer generation
  - enhanced energy implementation (Frog2's is basically torsion and Van der Waals)

=========================================================================

- **CONTRIBUTING**: 

 The Frog2 project is open to external contributions:

 Our time to enhance and maintain Frog2 is sparse. Feel free to contribute!
